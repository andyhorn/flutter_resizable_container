## 2.0.0-beta.2

- Added a new `ResizableSize` class that defines a "size" in pixels or as a ratio
- Changed the `startingRatio` in the `ResizableChild` to `startingSize` that takes an optional `ResizableSize`
    - This change allows the starting size of a child to be defined as an absolute value (in logical pixels) or as a ratio of the available space
    - If there is a mixture of pixels and ratio sizes, the pixel sizes will be given priority and then the ratio sizes will be given the remaining available space
- Added a `setSizes` method to the `ResizableController` that takes a list of optional `ResizableSize`s. These sizes will be applied to the current children following the same rules as noted above
- Removed the `ratios` setter in favor of the new `setSizes` method
- Made the controller an optional param in the `ResizableContainer` ctor

## 2.0.0-beta.1

- Renamed `ResizableChildData` to `ResizableChild`
- Added an `expand` flag to the `ResizableChild` ctor 
    - If there is a `startingRatio` set and this flag is `true`, the child will automatically expand to fill any remaining available space. If this flag is `false`, the child will only expand to meet its `startingRatio` constraint
    - If the `startingRatio` is `null`, the child will automatically expand to fill any remaining available space, regardless of whether or not this flag is set
- Move the list of `ResizableChild` objects out of the `ResizableController` and _back_ into the `ResizableContainer` as the `children` parameter
    - This allows the list of children to be modified on-the-fly without recreating a `ResizableController`

## 1.0.0

First stable version!

- Encapsulation of divider configuration in a new `ResizableDivider` class
    - Divider `thickness` and `size` properties, mirroring the Flutter Divider's `thickness` and `width` properties, have been added
    - `onHoverEnter` and `onHoverExit` callbacks allow you to react to the user's interactions with the divider
- All size tracking and calculations have been moved out of the `ResizableContainer` widget and into the `ResizableController`
    - This fixed several bugs and improves performance by converting the `ResizableContainer` to a `StatelessWidget` (from stateful)
- `ResizableContainer` now requires a `List<Widget>` as its `children` property, as the `List<ResizableChildData>` have been moved into the `ResizableController`
- Added and improved tests
- Added a GH workflow to deploy the example app to GH Pages

## 0.4.1

- Add tests for `ResizableController`
- Add tests for `ResizableContainer`
- Add GitHub Actions workflow

## 0.4.0

- Add `ResizableController` to allow programmatic control of resizable children
- Fix a bug causing adjacent containers to grow in size when the target container reaches is minimum size

## 0.3.0

- Make divider color and width customizable

## 0.2.1

- Fix package description to improve pub.dev score

## 0.2.0

- Update the Dart SDK constraints to >=3.0.0 <4.0.0

## 0.1.3

## 0.1.0

- Rework dividers to lie in-line with child widgets, taking up space 
  along the primary axis, instead of being placed in a stack and positioned 
  according to the child sizes
- Add a custom divider who's width is known and can be controlled to ease 
  calculating the available space for child widgets
- Remove the optionality of the divider - this widget is now required to be 
  visible, as hiding it would disable the resize functionality
