## Features

- `ResizableContainer`s are fully nestable and support LTR _and_ RTL layouts
- Customize the look and feel of the divider(s) between children
- Respond to user interactions with `onHoverEnter` and `onHoverExit` for web/desktop and `onTapDown` and `onTapUp` for mobile
- Programmatically set the sizes of the children through a `ResizableController`
- Respond to changes in the sizes of the resizable children by listening to the `ResizableController`

## Getting started

Add this package to your `pubspec.yaml` or install using `flutter pub add`.

```dart
flutter pub add flutter_resizable_container
```

## Usage

### Direction

Add a `ResizableContainer` to your widget tree and give it a `direction` of type `Axis` - this is the direction in which the `children` will be laid out and the direction in which their size will be allowed to flex.

```dart
ResizableContainer(
  direction: Axis.horizontal,
  ...
)
```

In the example above, any children (more on this in the [ResizableChild](#resizable-child) section) will take up the maximum available height while being allowed to adjust their widths.

### ResizableController

#### Setup

If you wish to respond to changes in sizes or to programmatically adjust child sizes, create a `ResizableController` and keep a reference to it; then, pass it to the `ResizableContainer`'s constructor.

For example:

```dart
final controller = ResizableController();

...

ResizableContainer(
    controller: controller,
),
```

#### Using a ResizableController

Using the controller, you can listen to changes as well as programmatically set the sizes of the container's children.

```dart
final controller = ResizableController();

@override
void initState() {
    super.initState();

    controller.addListener(() {
        // ... react to size change events
        final List<double> pixels = controller.pixels;
        print(pixels.join(', '));
    });
}

@override
void dispose() {
    controller.dispose(); // don't forget to dispose your controller
    super.dispose();
}

// (somewhere else in your code)
// use the `setSizes` method to programmatically set the sizes of the
// container's children.
//
// This method takes a list of ResizableSize objects - more on this below.
onTap: () => controller.setSizes(const [
    ResizableSize.pixels(250),
    ResizableSize.ratio(0.25),
    ResizableSize.expand(),
]);
```

### ResizableChild

To add widgets to your container, you must provide a `List<ResizableChild>`, each of which contain the child `Widget`, an optional `ResizableDivider`, and an optional `ResizableSize`.

```dart
children: [
    const ResizableChild(
        divider: ResizableDivider(
            thickness: 2,
            color: Colors.blue,
        ),
        size: ResizableSize.expand(max: 350),
        child: NavBarWidget(),
    ),
    const ResizableChild(
        divider: ResizableDivider(
            thickness: 2,
            padding: 3,
        ),
        child: BodyWidget(),
    ),
    const ResizableChild(
        size: ResizableSize.ratio(0.25, min: 100),
        child: SidePanelWidget(),
    ),
],
```

In the example above, the first two children have a custom `ResizableDivider` (read more about dividers in the [ResizableDivider](#resizabledivider) section). If no divider is set, a default one will be used. The divider provided to a child will be used between itself and the _next_ child in the list - the divider of the last child will not be used.

Each child also provides a custom size configuration:
  * The first child, containing the `NavBarWidget`, has a maximum size of 350px.
  * The second child, containing the `BodyWidget`, is set to automatically expand to fill the available space via the default `ResizableSize.expand()` value.
  * The third child, containing the `SidePanelWidget`, is set to a ratio of 0.75 with a minimum size of 100px.

The `size` parameter gives a directive of how to size the child during the initial layout, resizing, and screen size changes. See the [Resizable Size](#resizable-size) section below for more information. 

### ResizableSize

The `ResizableSize` class defines a "size" as a ratio of the available space, using the `.ratio` constructor, an absolute size in logical pixels, using the `.pixels` constructor, an auto-expanding size using the `expand` constructor, or `shrink`, which will conform to the natural size of its child. 

The `max` parameter constrains the child and will prevent it from being expanded beyond that size in the `direction` of the container.

The `min` parameter constrains the child and will prevent it from being _shrunk_ below that size in the `direction` of the container.

**Note:** When using `shrink`, the rendering engine will throw an error if its child does not have a natural size, such as a `LayoutBuilder`.

For example, to create a size equal to half of the available space:

```dart
const half = ResizableSize.ratio(0.5);
```

To create a size of 300px:

```dart
const threeHundredPixels = ResizableSize.pixels(300);
```

To allow a child to fill any remaining space:

```dart
const expandable = ResizableSize.expand();
```

#### Size Hierarchy

When the controller is laying out the sizes of children, it uses the following rules:

1. If a child has a size using pixels, it will be given that amount of space, clamped within its min/max bounds (if present)
2. If a child has a `shrink` size, it will be laid out and given its natural size, clamped within its min/max bounds (if present)
3. If a child has a size using a ratio, it will be given the proportionate amount of the _remaining_ space _after_ all pixel- and shrink-sizes have been allocated, clamped within its min/max bounds (if present)
4. If a child has a size using `expand`, it will be given whatever space is left after the allocations in the previous steps - If there are multiple children using `expand`, the remaining space will be distributed between them based on their `flex` value (similar to `Expanded` widgets) and clamped within their min/max bounds (if present)

##### Example 1

Take the following list:

```dart
// available space = 500px
controller.setSizes(const [
    ResizableSize.pixels(300),
    ResizableSize.ratio(0.25),
    ResizableSize.ratio(0.5),
]);
```

When the controller is allocating space, the first child will be given 300px, leaving 200px of available space.

The second child will be given 1/4 of the remaining 200px, equal to 50px.

The third child will be given 1/2 of the remaining 200px, equal to 100px.

**Note:** In this scenario, there will be 50px of "unclaimed" space.

##### Example 2

Another way of distributing space could be:

```dart
// available space = 500px
controller.setSizes(const [
    ResizableSize.pixels(300),
    ResizableSize.expand(),
    ResizableSize.ratio(0.25),
]);
```

In this example, the first child will be given 300px, leaving 200px of available space.

The third child will be given 1/4 of the remaining 200px, equaling 50px.

The second child will be given the space remaining after the other allocations, equaling 150px.

##### Example 3

```dart
// available space = 500px
controller.setSizes(const [
    ResizableSize.pixels(300),
    ResizableSize.expand(),
    ResizableSize.expand(),
]);
```

In this scenario, the first child will be given 300px, leaving 200px of available space.

The remaining 200px will be evenly distributed between the `expand` children, resulting in each child being given a size of 100px.

###### Example 4

```dart
// available space = 500px
controller.setSizes(const [
    ResizableSize.pixels(100),
    ResizableSize.expand(max: 100),
    ResizableSize.expand(),
]);
```

In this scenario, the first child will be given 100px, leaving 400px of available space.

The remaining space will attempt to be divided evenly between the two `expand` sizes, since they have equal `flex` values (defaults to 1). However, the first `expand` has a maximum size of 100px, so this child will only be given 100px and the last child will be given 300px.

###### Flex

The `ResizableSize.expand` constructor takes an optional `flex` parameter of type `int`. If there are multiple `expand` sizes, the available space will be divided by total flex count and then distributed to the children according to their individual flex values - this is the same as the `Flexible` and `Expanded` widgets.

For example:

```dart
ResizableChild(
    size: ResizableSize.expand(flex: 2),
),
ResizableChild(
    size: ResizableSize.expand(), // defaults to flex: 1
),
```

In this scenario, the first child would be given 2/3 of the total available space while the second child received 1/3.

### ResizableDivider

Use the `ResizableDivider` class to customize the look and feel of the dividers between each of a container's children.

You can customize the `thickness`, `length`, `crossAxisAlignment`, `mainAxisAlignment`, and `color` of the divider, as well as display a custom mouse cursor on hover and respond to `onHoverEnter` and `onHoverExit` (web) and `onTapDown` and `onTapUp` (mobile) events.

```dart
divider: ResizableDivider(
    thickness: 2,
    padding: 5,
    length: const ResizableSize.ratio(0.25),
    onHoverEnter: () => setState(() => hovered = true),
    onHoverExit: () => setState(() => hovered = false),
    color: hovered ? Colors.blue : Colors.black,
    cursor: SystemMouseCursors.grab,
),
```

# Sizing

The `thickness` and `length` properties control the size of the line drawn on the screen. The `length` determines the cross-axis size - how "long" the line is - while `thickness` determines the main-axis size. The `length` property is of type `ResizableSize`, giving you the flexibility to set a responsive size, using `.ratio`, or a fixed size, using `.pixels`.

Note: If you set an absolute length that is smaller than the available space, the divider will fit to the available space and not overflow.

# Alignment and padding

If the divider's length is less than the total available space, you can use the `crossAxisAlignment` to control its cross-axis position. For example, a vertical divider set to `CrossAxisAlignment.start` will be positioned at the top of its space. The default value is `.center`.

![Cross-Axis Alignment](./doc/screenshot_cross_axis_start.png?raw=true 'Cross-Axis Alignment')

By adding a `padding` value, additional (empty) space will be added around/alongside the divider. The `mainAxisAlignment` property can then be used to control its position within this space on the main axis. For example, a vertical divider set to `MainAxisAlignment.start` will be positioned at the very left edge of the available space for a vertical divider.
