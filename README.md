**ResizableContainer**s add flexibility and personalization to your UI.

## Features

* Nest as many `ResizableContainer`s as you want
* Configure each child's initial size, minimum size, and/or maximum size
* Customize the width, color, and indentation of the divider(s) between children
* Programmatically change the ratios of the children at any time

## Getting started

Add this package to your `pubspec.yaml` or install using the command line.

```dart
flutter pub add flutter_resizable_container
```

## Usage

First, add a `ResizableContainer` to your widget tree and give it a `direction` of type `Axis`: this is the direction in which the child objects will be laid out and the direction in which the children's size will be allowed to flex.

You can also provide a `dividerWidth`, `dividerIndent`, `dividerEndIntent`, and/or `dividerColor` to customize the appearance of the dividers between children.

```dart
ResizableContainer(
  direction: Axis.horizontal,
  dividerWidth: 5,
  dividerColor: Colors.blue,
  dividerIndent: 5,
  dividerEndIndent: 5,
  children: [
    // ...
  ],
)
```

Second, add a list of `ResizableChildData` objects containing configuration data for each child element:

  * `child: Widget` - the widget to be displayed in the UI and resized by the user
  * `startingRatio: double` - this ratio will be used to determine the child's initial size upon the first render, based on the available space of the parent `ResizableContainer`. 
    
    **Note**: this value is required for each child and the sum of all of a container's child ratios must equal `1.0`

  * `minSize: double?` (optional) - this value indicates the absolute minimum size (in logical pixels) this child can take; any adjustments that would reduce the child's size _below_ this value will be ignored
  * `maxSize: double?` (optional) - similar to the [minSize], this indicates the absolute maximum size (in logical pixels) this child can take; any adjustments that would increase the child's size _above_ this value will be ignored

### Example

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return ResizableContainer(
    direction: Axis.horizontal,
    dividerWidth: 3.0,
    dividerColor: Colors.blue,
    children: [
      ResizableChildData(
        startingRatio: 0.75,
        minSize: 150,
        child: const Center(
          child: Text('Left 3/4'),
        ),
      ),
      ResizableChildData(
        startingRatio: 0.25,
        maxSize: 500,
        child: const Center(
          child: ResizableContainer(
            direction: Axis.vertical,
            dividerColor: Colors.green,
            children: [
              ResizableChildData(
                startingRatio: 0.5,
                child: const Center(
                  child: Text('Upper right'),
                ),
              ),
              ResizableChildData(
                startingRatio: 0.5,
                child: const Center(
                  child: Text('Lower right'),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ],
  );
}
```

![ResizableContainer example](doc/screenshot.png)

In the example, there is a two-pane (horizontal layout) container with a divider and grab-handle 3/4 of the way across the screen from the left-hand side.

Using this handle, a user could shrink the left-hand pane down to its minimum size of 150px _or_ until the right-hand pane expands to its maximum size of 500px, whichever comes first. 

They can also adjust the height of the two vertically-stacked children on the right side. These right-side children are given unbounded flexibility, which means each one can take the full space (with the other being given 0px height and no longer appearing on the screen).

### Using a controller

When creating a `ResizableChildData`, you provide a `startingRatio` to give it a size relative to the available space. After the frame builds, the user may freely resize it and any other child. To set the ratio programmatically, use a `ResizableController`: 

```dart
final controller = ResizableController();

// ...

child: ResizableContainer(
  controller: controller,
  child: // ...
```

Then, using `controller.setRatios`, you can set the ratios for all the children at once. This function has the same limitation as `startingRatio` in that all the ratios must add to one, and there must be one ratio per child. 

```dart
void printControllerInfo() {
  print("Details about the controller: ");
  print("  Ratios: ${controller.ratios}");
  print("  Absolute Sizes: ${controller.sizes}");
  print("  Available space: ${controller.availableSpace}");
  print("  Number of children: ${controller.numChildren}");
}

void resetRatios() {
  // Assuming this controller only has two children
  controller.setRatios([0.5, 0.5]);
}
```

Be sure to dispose the controller when you're done with it:

```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  controller.dispose();
  super.dispose();
}
```
